<h2>SWT example - Paint Tool</h2>

<p>	
This example demonstrates the use of SWT graphics operations in the form of a
rudimentary bitmap painting program.  The Paint Tool implementation also 
demonstrates a mechanism for managing timed GUI operations in the background 
that are triggered by user input.
</p>
<p>	
Select a tool with which to draw in the drawing area.  There are a number of tools
to choose from on the toolbar.  To change the color selection, click on a color in the
palette below the drawing area; left-click to set the foreground color, right-click to set the
background color.
</p>
