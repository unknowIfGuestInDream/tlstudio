<h2>
<b>Example - Property Sheet</b></h2>

<h3>
Introduction</h3>
The Property Sheet Example adds an editor for files with the .usr extension
and also demonstrates how to add properties and outline views on a file.
<br>&nbsp;
<h3>
Running the example</h3>
To start using the Property Sheet Example, create a file with extension
.usr.&nbsp;&nbsp; Open the file and the Outline and Properties views to
see the example in action.&nbsp; Click on items in the Outline view and
look in the Properties view for details of the selected item in the Outline
view.&nbsp; The people items in the list show the most detail in the Properties
view.
<h4>
<b>Creating a new usr file</b></h4>
Create a new file with file extension .usr.&nbsp; From the File menu, select
New and then select Other... from the sub-menu.&nbsp; Click on Simple in
the wizard, then select
<br>File in the list on the left.&nbsp; Click on Next to supply the file

<h3>
Details</h3>
The Property Sheet Example demonstrates how to provide properties to the
Property Sheet View.
<p>The tree viewer of the Content Outline View contains and presents OrganizationElements.
When an element is selected in the Content Outline View the Workspace will
invoke <tt>getAdapter</tt>
on the selected OrganizationElement. If an adapter is requested for IPropertySource,
the OrganizationElement returns itself as it impements IPropertySource
The Property Sheet View then use the Organization Element as it source.
