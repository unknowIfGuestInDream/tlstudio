<h2>
<b>Example - Multi-page Editor</b></h2>

<h3>
Introduction</h3>
The&nbsp; Multi Page Editor Example adds an editor for files with the .mpe
extension. It shows how to create an editor that uses multiple pages by
defining both an editor and a page contributor that can add entries to
an action bar.
<h3>
Running the example</h3>
To start using the Multi-page Editor Example, create a new file with .mpe
extension.&nbsp; Select the file, bring up the popup menu, select the Open
With menu and from the sub-menu select the Multi Page Editor Example menu
item. You can then select the different editors by selecting the different
tabs.
<h4>
<b>Creating a new mpe file</b></h4>
Create a new file with file extension .mpe.&nbsp; From the File menu, select
New and then select Other... from the sub-menu.&nbsp; Click on Simple in
the wizard, then select
<br>File in the list on the left.&nbsp; Click on Next to supply the file
name (make sure the extension is .mpe) and the folder in which the file
should be contained.
<br>&nbsp;
<h3>
Details</h3>
The&nbsp; Multi Page Editor Example demonstrates how to create an multi
page editor with a custom page contributor.
<p>The Multi Page Editor Example is constructed with two extensions - a
document contributor (MultiPageContributor) and an editor (MultiPageEditor).
The document contributor is a subclass of <tt>org.eclipse.ui.part.MultiPageEditorActionBarContributor</tt>
and defines the actions that are added to an editor when the <tt>setActivePage</tt>
method is called. The editor is an <tt>org.eclipse.ui.part.MultiPageEditorPart</tt>
that creates 3 pages whose activation is handled by the <tt>pageChange</tt>
method that in turn sends <tt>setActivePage</tt>
to the contributor. These two classes do not refer to each other directly
- the contributor for the editor is set using the contributorClass tag
in the plugin.xml
